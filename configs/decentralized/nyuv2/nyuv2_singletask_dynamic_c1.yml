# C1: Proposal1 - Backbone-Only Dynamic Clustering v2
# Advanced: Dynamic soft clustering with gradient similarity
#
# Improvements from FIXED version:
# Early stopping (patience=8)
# Learning rate scheduler
# Expected to reduce client variance and improve consistency

# Expected results:
# - Training stops at Round 28-35
# - Best loss: ~0.75-0.78 (vs 0.8415 in FIXED)
# - Improvement: 10-15%
# - Reduced client variance (vs 0.70-1.04 in FIXED)
#
# Investigation:
# - Why did clients 2 and 5 perform poorly in FIXED?
# - Will early stopping reduce variance?
# - Is backbone-only aggregation suitable for dynamic clustering?
